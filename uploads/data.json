    "description": "SYNOPSIS MR. RUDOLPHO’S JUBILEE is the 6th feature film from the independent movie & music team, Bright Blue Gorilla (writer/director Michael Glover and producer Robyn Rosenkrantz). It’s a surreal comedy romance, told by two “Musical Angels”, aka Bright Blue Gorilla as the Greek Chorus. Part screwball comedy, part Bohemian musical, with a pinch of cop-show thrown in for flavor, Mr. Rudolpho’s Jubilee deliciously mixes up form and mashes up genre. Mr. Rudolpho is an Italian fashion designer. Rich, famous, and depressed. Surrounded by the luxury of his Tuscan villa, monitored 24/7 by a security team and reviled by the CEO of Rudolpho Inc., he’s become a prisoner of success. Rudolpho’s been sketching something in his moleskin book for months, but nobody knows what it is. Turns out he’s making plans for suicide. Good timing, because the CEO is planning to bump him off. (Dead icons are profitable, just ask Chanel or Gucci.) Rudolpho heads to Berlin for Fashion Week to do himself in, with the killers not far behind. But, this being a Bright Blue Gorilla film, things don’t always go as planned... Through a series of events he is thrown in with some off-the-grid artists - the Boheems - who have no idea who he is. Thinking he’s destitute, they invite him to stay. Meanwhile, cops, killers, reporters, and Interpol all search for him. Rudolpho, happy in his hide-out, is hanging with the Boheems - and maybe falling for one of them..",

A young girl, Greta, is brought in, Lotte takes care of her and a gentle affection develops between them. But this happiness is short-lived because, a little later, witnesses an encounter between Greta and Marcel. The three catch sight of each other and Lotte realises she will not be able to run away this time. Something seems to be coming together which does not belong together. Lotte’s own wounds, apparently healed, are reopened by this moment",

The former military dictatorship carried out a few democratic reforms, but he remains sceptical: In his opinion, the country hasn’t changed yet. Along with the members of his punk band, he tries to raise the awareness of his people about the persistent violation of human rights. By way of his music and the demonstrations in the streets, he criticizes the ongoing civil war and the persecutions of ethnic minorities. He travels across the country to promote his own philosophy among the young generations: A symbiosis of Buddhism and punk that rejects religious dictates and political doctrine.",

The film will follow the process of the dancers during their research and aims to portray how a non-refugee can connect to the experiences of a refugee, and to reflect about ourselves in this relationship. \nI started the dance-theatre project \"Connecting Fingers\" as an experiment, with the idea that it would turn into a film. I wanted to follow the idea of using the body to represent a story. Many elements from the interviews I conducted with refugees combined to create a dramaturgy in a way that I did not expect. I did not know where it was leading, but I was interested in the process of how my dancers would get involved emotionally and physically, confronting themselves while interpreting stories which belong to other people. In analyzing this process, I realized that there is much more to discover. This is the how the idea of the film \"When I Dance\" was born",

During the Nazi era an aircraft factory was located here and forced labourers had to build outboardwings. Looking for traces of the past, the filmmakers encounter two men, leading a wayward life. They have become friends through the passion of collecting: One of them preserves disused and old items, the other reads from them. Everything is steeped in history, the people and the place, even what lies beneath the earth. No monument tells you how to feel, so it is a bizarre life on a supposedly deserted island which can be both an abyss and paradise at the same time.",
